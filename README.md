* GFLW sample: Rendering to an OpenGL texture and integrating as part of an OpenGL application with keyboard and mouse events and clipboard support
* PNG sample: Rendering to a PNG file. Ported from official sample 1 code.

Then obtain Ultralight SDK from https://ultralig.ht/ and extract its contents into `libs/Ultralight-beef/dist/sdk`. Run the code (for example by using Beef IDE or command line tools).
